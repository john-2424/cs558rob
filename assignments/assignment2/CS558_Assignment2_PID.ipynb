        "- [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) is a toolkit for developing planning and control algorithms. It provides a standard API that abstracts away the model of the robot's environment. It is primarily used for reinforcement learning agents, but can work with any controller, including the PD controllers you'll build in this assignment.\n",
        "  - If you've never used gym, be sure to read this short [tutorial](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) before getting started.\n",

        "- [pybullet-gym](https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym) is an open-source library that implements a variety of gym environments using PyBullet as the backend. One of these environments is `ReacherPyBulletEnv-v0`, the robotic arm that you'll be working with.\n",
